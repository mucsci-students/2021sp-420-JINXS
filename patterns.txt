Sprint 4 Design Patterns

Jon, Ian B., Nate, Xavier, Simon


1. MVC
   - (Approved Sprint 3)


2. Observer:
   - handleDrag in the GUI notifies the dragged panel, global position variables, memento, and relationship arrows
     every time a panel is dragged through a one-to-many dependency. (Approved Sprint 3)
   File Name: UMLGUI.java  
   Line #: 1514 - 1531


3. Memento:
   - Exists in its own file and has implementation for the GUI and the command line. Used for undo and redo. (Approved Sprint 3)
   File Name: Memento.java  
   Line #: 1 - 36


4. Iterator:
   - Iterator implemented on list of UMLClasses in 3 separate methods.
   File Name: UMLEditor.java 
   Line #: 79 - 86, 109 - 116, and 485 - 491


5. Adapter:
   - The terminal/CLI uses the Arrays.asList() method to convert a String array to a list so that an ArrayList can be
     constructed from the resulting collection (list). Noted as an adapter by refactoring.guru Java code examples.
   File Name: UMLTerminal.java
   Line #: 68


6. Composite:
   - Java Swing: The GUI uses Swing which is a composite structure. The JFrame contains JPanels which contain JTextAreas, and each
     can be treated as their own individual object including their children. Noted as composite by refactoring.guru Java code examples.
   File Name: UMLGUI.java


7. Builder:
   - The UMLTabCompleter builds tab completion objects piece by piece and it utilized by our UMLTerminal.
   File Name: UMLTabCompleter.java


8. Prototype:
   - Our UMLClass model implements a copy constructor to create an identical new class but with a different name. This
     is then used as an available command in the CLI.
   File Name: UMLClass.java
   Line #: 29 - 37


9. Decorator:
   - Graphics2D objects are wrapped in JPanels to give them increased functionality and to allow for correct
     custom painting of Swing objects based on Oracle documentation by overriding the JPanels' painComponent method.
   File Name: RelArrow.java


10. Bridge:
   - UMLField, UMLMethod, and UMLParam all extend the UMLAttr interface which defines how they all relate on an abstraction
     level while the classes themselves do the implementation on their own.
   File Names: UMLField.java, UMLMethod.java, UMLParam.java, and UMLAttr.java


11. Command:
   - The CLI implements its own command object that turns most of the CLI commands into their own stand-alone
     objects that contain all of the necessary info about the command. The command object also takes care of
     execution of each command in its own class. All command classes extend the CLICommand class implementation.

12. Builder:
   - The GUI uses a builder to construct each panel (class box) that will be displayed. The GUIClassPanelBuilder
     implements the Builder interface and constructs GUIClassPanels in steps from their TextArea pieces.
